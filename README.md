## Description

This website works as a digital dream journal for users to keep record of their dreams overtime while also creating positive and productive morning routines in its user. Wake Up & Dream starts its user's day off with positivity by including an inspirational quote of the day, image of the day, current moon phase, and a mood tracker. It has been shown in studies that your mood when first waking up sets the tone for the rest of your day and greatly influences your productivity as well as your mood. This app creates a convenient way to establish a positive morning routine without too much prep.  We were motivated by the idea that the average person wakes up and immediately navigates to Instagram or some other kind of platform whose mission does not include helping to brighten your mood and can actually do the opposite by showing you negative images that can stay within your subconscious all day long.  In addition, this app can be helpful for people who use the symbolism of their dreams and the changes in their mood to analyze their psychological/overall health.
